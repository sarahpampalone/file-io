# file-io

/* This program opens both an input and output file on the computer.
The input file should have several lines with 1 number in each line.
The program asks the user how many lines this input file has, so it knows how many iterations to do.
An array of entered size is dynamically allocated and filled with the numbers from the input file.
A function is then used to find the maximum value, using a series of if statements.
This maximum number is then printed to the output file.
